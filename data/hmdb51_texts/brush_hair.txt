Preparing your hair
Brush Your Hair Step 1 Version 4.jpg
1
Wash your hair in warm water with a shampoo suitable for your type of hair. Use conditioner, wait a few minutes, and rinse it off completely. Rinse your hair with cold water to get a healthy looking shine. Towel dry by wrapping your hair in a towel. Tousling hair with a towel will only create tangles. (No blowdryer or curler/straightener, these damage hair.)
If your hair doesn't need washing, skip this section.

Use a clean comb, and slowly comb through the tangles created while washing your hair. Use a wide toothed comb and avoid too much brushing as hair is fragile when wet. It's best to comb out the ends first, then detangle a few inches higher repeatedly until you've done your whole length.

Allow hair to air-dry before you brush it, to avoid damage. This can take a while, but it's better for the hair than blow drying. Running your fingers through it periodically and fluffing the roots a little will speed the process.

Start at the roots. From there, work the brush through your hair to the tip. Do this with each section, one at a time. Remember where the sections were and don't rush. When all sections are brushed, you're done.

Tips
Be gentle when you are brushing your hair; friction causes split ends.
While brushing or combing, start from the ends and work your way up. This will prevent catching a knot while brushing or combing.
Different types of brushes are made for different types of things so make sure the one you use is right for your hair.
When your hair is knotty, start brushing from the tips up until you can easily glide down from your scalps to your tips.
A boar's bristle brush is best for spreading the oil on your scalp down to the tips of your hair. This leads to softer, healthier hair. Bristle brushes are available at most drug stores, and at many hair salons. They are not good for detangling, so do that with a smooth wide-tooth comb.
Plait or braid your hair before you go to sleep because when you wake up it will have less tangles therefore being easier and faster to brush through.
Try using a paddle brush. This will make your hair soft.
If your hair gets frizzy, try dampening your hands and running them over the frizz.
If you start at the ends of your hair the brush starts detangling your hair. You slowly work the brush up and brush from the roots down.
Adding conditioner makes brushing your hair a lot smoother.
You should always start from the bottom of your hair when brushing to remove the tangles. Work your way up to your roots.
Warnings
Be careful sleeping in hair binders. You may end up with bumps in your hair. Do not secure them too tight, you could also get a headache.
If you brush curly or wavy hair dry, it may get frizzy.
Too much brushing can damage your hair.[1]
