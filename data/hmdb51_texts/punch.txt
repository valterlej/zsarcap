There are several ways to throw a good punch, but you've got to make sure to use good technique and use your hips to generate torque. If you're keen on defending yourself or are preparing to become a boxer, knowing how to throw a punch is extremely important.

Throwing a Corkscrew Punch
Image titled Throw a Punch Step 41
Position your body. Before you begin throwing punches, you will need to get yourself into position. Close your fingers and tighten them into fists. Then, raise up your fists in front of you. Make sure your knuckles are not jutting out, or in any way protruding. Your thumbs should be next to your fingers, not under them.
You feet should be firmly planted and shoulder width apart with your knees bent a little less than 45 degrees.
Your elbows should be pointing straight out behind you.

Punch in slow motion a few times. Extend your arm straight forward and connect with your target. Try punching slowly a few times: bring your hand forward, rotating your fist until it has turned just past an upright position, and then drive with your top knuckle.
When you throw a corkscrew punch, your fist should rotate from a palm up position when starting the punch to a palm down position when landing the punch.[1]
Make sure that you incorporate your shoulder muscles in the punch as well. You should not just be twisting at the wrist, your whole arm should be involved in throwing the punch.[2]

Speed it up. After you have thrown a few slow corkscrew punches, you can start to speed things up. Make sure you are timing the rotation and drive of your knuckles with the extension of your arm.
You'll also need to make sure you let yourself pull your arm back, loosely flexing your elbow at the end of the punch. Otherwise, you may hurt your elbow (or worse) if you punch too hard, and without restraint.
Remember, if there's no one to absorb your blow when fully outstretched, your elbow will have to take the full force. Retracting at the end lets your muscles take the load.

Jabbing

1
Make fists. Close your hands so that they are both forming fists. Then, lower your chin and lift up your fists so they are covering your face. This will make it easier for you to defend yourself from any incoming punches.
Remember to keep your thumb next to your fingers, not underneath them.

Position your feet. Having your feet in the correct position will allow your body to generate power and this will result in better punches. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and then place one foot slightly behind the other.
Your feet do not need to be too far apart. Just take a small step back with one foot.
Bend your knees slightly.

Throw the punch straight out. When you are ready to throw your first punch, extend one arm straight out in front of you. As you do so, do not move any other part of your body.[3] The jab punch only uses the throwing arm. There is no rotation or other movement to worry about.
If you have a punching bag or other target, make sure that it is close enough to you to hit it.
If you are just punching the air, then try to visualize an imaginary target to help you aim your punches.

Keep your other hand up to guard your face. As you punch, do not bring your other fist down. It is there to protect your face. If you lower it, then your face will be vulnerable to attack.

Bring your jabbing arm back to the starting position. After you throw the punch, bring your arm back to its starting position in front of your face. Then, try punching with the other hand. Jabs are powerful punches, but they can also be useful for strategic reasons. You can throw a jab to:
Gauge the distance of your combatant. If you throw a jab and it doesn't connect, you know you need to move closer in order to throw a punch that hits the target.
Keep your combatant away from you. Throwing a jab, or a series of jabs, is a way of keeping your combatant from getting too close to you.

Landing a Hook

1
Get into a hook position. Start with your fist out in front of you to protect yourself. When you are ready to throw a hook punch, bring one elbow down and towards your side. Then raise your arm up so that it about even with your shoulder and your elbow is bent at a 90 degree angle.[4]
Make sure you are standing with your feet shoulder width apart and your knees bent slightly. Keeping your knees bent will help to increase the power of your punches.[5]
Keep your other fist in front of your face to protect it.

Pivot on your front foot as you explode with your leading arm. Twisting your body as you punch generates power and makes your punch more devastating. When you are ready to deliver the punch, shift your weight to your back foot and then pivot on your front foot.
Pivoting as you punch will help you to deliver a much more powerful punch because your entire body will be behind it.[6]
Don’t pivot until you are ready to punch. Remember that pivoting and punching need to happen at the same time.[7]

Throw the punch with a side-arc at a horizontal angle. When you are ready, throw the punch towards your target while twisting your hips. Remember that your throwing arm should be bent at a 90 degree angle as you punch. There are a couple different variations to this punch:
The European hook: your thumb, if it were to be extended, should point in at you as your hook connects. You don't want to extend your thumb out as you punch; keep it in a fist. This is a good hook if there is a short distance between you and your opponent.
The American hook: your thumb, if it were to be extended, should point up as your hook connects. Again, don't extend your thumb. This is a good hook if there is a lot of distance between you and your opponent.
The Mexican hook: the punch is thrown at a 45 degree angle instead of a completely horizontal angle. This is a blend of a hook and an uppercut.

Use your leading elbow to block any punches or parries. After you throw your hook, you will be in a good position to swat away any incoming punches from your opponent. If your opponent tries to throw a jab, then you can easily bring your arm down and swat away the punch.

Connecting with an Uppercut
Image titled Throw a Punch Step 17
1
Position your fists and feet. Start with both fists out in front of you. Stand with one leg slightly in front of the other and your knees bent slightly. Bending your knees is especially important for this punch because it will allow you to generate more power.[8]

Twist your hips down. When you deliver an uppercut, you might think that you would need to jump or twist upwards. However, you will deliver a more powerful punch if you twist your hips down and pivot on one foot as you punch.
You will be pivoting on the same side as your throwing arm. For example, if you are going to be delivering an uppercut with your left arm, then you will pivot on your left foot and bring your left hip down slightly.[9]

Dip your throwing arm a tiny bit. A lot of people who try to throw an uppercut bring their arm back like they are trying to throw a bowling ball; this is incorrect form. Don't bring your hand back very far at all. Just dip it down slightly before you throw your punch.
Your leading hand should be no lower than the bottom of your chest.

Twist as you bring your arm up. As you deliver the punch, twist your body and connect with your opponent’s body or chin. If done properly, the uppercut should stun your opponent and cause him to lose his balance temporarily, which will give you time to punch again.
Do not shift your weight from one leg to the other as you throw an uppercut. You just want to pivot your body as you throw the punch. You can distribute your weight evenly or place a little more weight on your throwing side, but do no shift your weight as you punch.[10]
