Finish swing with hips/belly pointing toward pitcher and the bat around the front shoulder
Always have confidence.
If you're serious about it, have a metalworker forge you a solid steel bat for you to carry around all day, the weight will build up your muscles and when you grab a normal bat, it will seem almost weightless and move much faster.
When you swing, just before the bat makes contact, pull your top hand on the bat close to your body, the swing is to be mainly driven by the shoulders and hips at the start. But at the end, it's in your arms, elbows and wrists. Try to sort of pull the bat towards yourself.
Some people like to line their upper knuckles up. Some people may not find this comfortable when swinging the bat. If it is not, then do not do this for it can irritate your wrists.
Use a bat weight that you find suitable, but make sure that when you hit, the ball will at least leave the infield.
Wear batting gloves when hitting the ball so vibration will not be such a factor in you hitting the ball.
Leaning on your back foot before the pitch is thrown is a good way to add a little more power to your swing but it can irritate your foot and your knee if not properly stretched.
Do not bring your body forward while swinging.
