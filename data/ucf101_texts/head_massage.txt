A scalp massage releases tension in the forehead and scalp areas, stimulating mental function. It is also a great way to help the circulation to your scalp and can serve as one part of a total nutrition and hair care regime to keeping your hair in good shape. Giving yourself a scalp massage is easy and something you can do to relieve tension anywhere â€“ sitting at the desk at work, sitting in a traffic jam, when watching TV, or preferably, when relaxing somewhere pleasant.
Method 1
Hands only method

The beauty of this massage is that it can be done anywhere without the need for anything other than your fingers.

    Sit down somewhere comfortable. The less distractions, the better so that you can concentrate on what is happening. However, there's no harm squeezing this into the ads of a favorite show provided you press the mute button!

    Place the fingers of both hands on your forehead. They should meet one another at an imaginary center line of your forehead. Rest the thumbs on your temples; they will provide support.

    Apply pressure. Make the pressure firm but light, as you press, then release.

    Keep moving this position up and onto the scalp, bit by bit, repeating the pressure/release movement. Follow the line of the Governor Vessel meridian (see "Tips"); approximately the center of your scalp.

    At the top of your head, apply pressure to your head at the acupoint Governor Vessel 20. This is located about three quarters of the way on the top of your scalp.

    Move down the back of your scalp now. Release the pressure from the acupoint Governor Vessel 20 and continue pressing down the center of your scalp line. As before, continue moving the fingers down in the same position, while moving the support thumbs down at the same time.

    Once you have reached the the base of your skull, return to the front. This time, position your hands about half an inch (1.27cm) either side of the mid-line of your head (in other words, this time your fingers won't be meeting but have a gap either side of the imaginary line across your forehead).

    Do the press and release movement as before in this new position, moving up and then down the scalp as before.

    Return and repeat. This time, make the gap between your fingers and the center line of your head 1 inch (2.5cm) either side. Your fingers should now be almost on the sides of your head.

    When you feel adept at this massage, synchronize it with your breathing, inhaling and exhaling as you press and release. This will help to calm you as well as allowing you to focus on the releasing tension to leave your scalp feeling refreshed.

Method 2
Oil method

This massage can be done in the bath, in the shower, or sitting somewhere comfortably. All you need is some essential oil, carrier oil, and hair-washing items.

    1
    Pick an essential oil that is good for your hair type. For example, if you have dandruff, use tea-tree or lavender. Use peppermint oil or rosemary oil if you are experiencing hair loss. If your hair is overly dry, use rose oil or chamomile oil.

    Prepare the scalp massage oil. Add the drops of essential oil to a massage oil medium (carrier oil); suitable massage oil mediums are almond oil or olive oil. For every tablespoon of the oil that you are using, only add a maximum of two drops essential oil.

    Brush your hair to prepare it. Brush your hair while tilting your head upside-down to improve circulation.
        If you have long hair, start at the ends of the hair to prevent breakage.

        Big paddle brushes are best for long hair; while natural bristle brushes are best for all hair types.

    Put a small amount of the prepared massage oil onto your fingers. Begin massaging in small circular motions near your temples, then move your fingers out over the rest of your scalp. Slowly, add more oil to the tips of your fingers when you need it.

    After all the oil is used up, place a warmed towel on your head and leave the oil on for approximately 10 minutes.

    Wash out the oil with a good shampoo and conditioner. If your hair is very dry, you can leave the oil in for a whole night and wash in the morning. While shampooing, you might have to wash twice to get the greasiness out; massage the shampoo in well (a second massage in disguise).

    Do this regularly, about once a week. It will reduce tension and may increase hair health along with a nutritious diet (which is the best way to improve your hair's health) and good styling.

Tips

    A good scalp massage can ward off or minimize a headache.
    When rinsing your hair, after all the oil has come off, quickly pour some cold water over your head to stimulate circulation.
    The Governor Vessel meridian is not visible to the naked eye; it is derived from an Oriental based theory of energy points and can be measured electrically. In Chinese, meridians are known as "Qi" or in Japanese as "Ki", often called "vital energy" in the English language. This particular meridian is thought to supply and unite the energy within all twelve meridians.[1]
    If you're under 18, you should ask for parent's permission before using any oil.
    Using ALMOST ANY kind of oil is good for your hair, (such as coconut oil, olive oil, etc) and can probably help it grow to 2-4 inches. Just be sure to not wash your hair everyday.

Warnings

    Be sure that the essential oils do not trigger any allergic reactions; know your triggers and the property of the oils before using them.
    Don't massage your scalp too roughly.You can make strands of your hair break and fall out from the rough treatment.
    As nice as cinnamon oil smells, stay away from using it on your scalp. It will burn if you accidentally get it in your eyes while you are rinsing.
